## Motivation: 
To build a MERN fullstack app that looks and functions like a utility app that's marketable. 

## Why? 
App fatigue pleagues certain management positions. Having formerly worked as a cook for a catering company and assisted with budgets and food inventory, we used multiple apps which caused miscomunication and delays. I wanted to make an app that serves as a one app solution to managing a catering company. 

## Built with: 
- React.js 
- Axios 
- Express 
- Node.js 
- mongoDB/mongoose 
- mongoDB Charts 
- Moment.js
- React Bootstrap 
- React-date-picker for calendar date selections. 
- React-number-format for phone numbers.  
- Adobe Photoshop and Sparks for logos and images. 
- Heroku for deployment. 

## Features: 
- Search bar 
- Sortable tables 
- Auto calculate "total costs" based on "to purchase" and "unit price". 
- mongoDb Charts display charts and graphs for total food costs per month, food expiration per month, how many clients added per month or total bookings cancelled. 

## Bugs: 
- Axios post requests sometimes fail in mobile web browser chrome and safari. If user switches to "Request Desktop Site" on Chrome the issue becomes null. 

## Roadmap: 
- Add JWT auth and create registar/sign in. 
- Add Google Sign-In. 
- Build Calendar View under Bookings. 
- Create Client Side Ordering and Checkout w/ React Credit Card or Stripe. 
- Utilizing mongoDB Charts SDK package. Build Customizable Client Side Rendering under Reports.
